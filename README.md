# wof-regioncode-lookup
This project exposes a stream that will modify pelias Document objects to include the 3 character country code.  It is a temporary project that is intended to fill the gap until [Who's on First PiP](https://github.com/whosonfirst/go-whosonfirst-pip) supports 3 character country codes.
